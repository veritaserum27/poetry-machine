Houses and rooms are full of perfumes, the shelves are crowded
with perfumes,
I breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it,
The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let it.
The atmosphere is not a perfume, it has no taste of the distillation,
it is odorless,
It is for my mouth forever, I am in love with it,
I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked,
I am mad for it to be in contact with me.

O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
The ship has weathered every rack the prize we sought is won
The port is near the bells I hear the people all exulting
While follow eyes the steady keel the vessel grim and daring
But O heart heart heart
O the bleeding drops of red
Where on the deck my Captain lies
Fallen cold and dead

O Captain my captain rise up and hear the bells
Rise up for you the flag is flung for you the bugle trills
For you bouquets and ribboned wreaths for you the shores a-crowding
For you they call the swaying mass their eager faces turning
Here captain dear father
This arm beneath your head
It is some dream that on the deck
You've fallen cold and dead

My captain does not answer his lips are pale and still
My father does not feel my arm he has no pulse nor will
The ship is anchored safe and sound its voyage closed and done
From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won
Exult O shores and ring O bells
But I with mournful tread
Walk the deck my Captain lies
Fallen cold and dead

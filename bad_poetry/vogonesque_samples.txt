oh little bug!
It does not slouch
the scratches resonate double-time
as happy chimes on a shiny day
that buzzes with the energy of a hive of maggots on a rotting corpse
now the slimy mound grossly festers and growls in hunger
like ravenous wolves in winter?


Fat Joe Kitty, my greatest joy:
He purrs and hisses something pretty
Fiercely like the wind does howl;
He sharpens his claws in anticipation
Hunger drives him to make a corpse of the little mouse.
He doesn't wait
He doesn't sleep
Now the angry pounce wildly arrives and hits with strength

oh little bug
It does not slouch
the scratches resonate double-time
as happy chimes on a shiny day
which buzzes with the energy of a hive of maggots on a rotting corpse
now the slimy mound grossly festers and growls in hunger
like thirty ravenous wolves in winter
This day is wonderful
Such a wonderful day

Fat Joe Kitty, my greatest joy:
He purrs and hisses something pretty
Fiercely like the wind does howl;
He sharpens his claws in anticipation
Hunger drives him to make a corpse of the little mouse.
He doesn't wait
He doesn't sleep
Now the angry pounce wildly arrives and hits with strength

The day is hot and long
I sweat great buckets of sour liquid
My flesh is slick and stinky
I wait for night

A very muggy day
Stretches into a tepid night
I slumber not
But still I dream
Of cool breezes on a sweaty brow

Peas mashed in a pot
Nine days old
Do develop an odor
And a layer of mold

Silly yellow daisies nod their pretty heads
Seven pretty children get tucked into beds
The moon rises up
The dog howls alone

They go up the hill
To pet a wild chicken
He falls down
He wears a frown
And she laughs at him

My dog is the best dog
He is a good boy
Every good boy does fine
Good boys do fine always

Are you alive
the robot asks
am I
I am
